ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Hitacium, a french guy still at highschool !

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested into a LOT of things here some :

- music production (Used to want to be producer)
- programming (Maybe I'll do some projects like games or apps in the future)
- aeronautic (a hidden passion)
- 3D modelling (I love any kind of art and I'd like to blend it with my programming level)
- mathematics (At the same time I always loved a bit maths, but recently I REALLY LOVE IT)

For the future, I don't really know what to do but it'll be maybe in mathematics, we'll see in 1 years ;) !

Software I use for those hobbies :

- Ableton
- Blender
- Affinity Photo
- Davinci Resolve
- Visual Studio
