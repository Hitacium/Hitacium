ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Hitacium, a french guy still at highschool (I have 17yo) !

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested into a LOT of things here some :

- **Music** â†’ Production  used to want to be producer, it'll stay a side project.
- **Programming** â†’ Always loved games, apps and how they were made, I'm not on GitHub for nothing!
- **Aeronautic** â†’ A hidden passion, I was planning to be pilot a while ago.
- **3D modelling** â†’ I love any kind of art and I'd like to blend it with programming
- **Mathematics** â†’ At the same time I always liked maths, but it's only recently that I started to really love it.

ðŸ“– I don't have precise plans for the future except that I like teaching and scientism
	â†’ I would probably blend everything I like together like being math teacher and scientist

	Software I use for those hobbies

		- Ableton
		- Blender
		- Affinity Photo
		- Davinci Resolve
		- Visual Studio
		- Unity/UE5
